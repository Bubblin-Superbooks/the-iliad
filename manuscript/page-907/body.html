Menelaus sends Antilochus to Achilles, with the news of Patroclus' death: then returns to the fight, where, though attacked with the utmost fury, he and Meriones, assisted by the Ajaces, bear off the body to the ships.</p><p>The time is the evening of the eight-and-twentieth day. The scene lies in the fields before Troy.</p><p>On the cold earth divine Patroclus spread,</p><p>Lies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead.</p><p>Great Menelaus, touch'd with generous woe,</p><p>Springs to the front, and guards him from the foe.</p><p>Thus round her new-fallen young the heifer moves,</p><p>Fruit of her throes, and first-born of her loves;</p><p>And anxious (helpless as he lies, and bare)</p><p>Turns, and re-turns her, with a mother's care,</p><p>Opposed to each that near the carcase came,</p><p>His broad shield glimmers, and his lances flame.</p></div> </div>
