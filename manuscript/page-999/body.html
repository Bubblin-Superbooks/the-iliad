<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Of those the locks with flowery wreath inroll'd;</p><p>Of these the sides adorn'd with swords of gold,</p><p>That glittering gay, from silver belts depend.</p><p>Now all at once they rise, at once descend,</p><p>With well-taught feet: now shape in oblique ways,</p><p>Confusedly regular, the moving maze:</p><p>Now forth at once, too swift for sight, they spring,</p><p>And undistinguish'd blend the flying ring:</p><p>So whirls a wheel, in giddy circle toss'd,</p><p>And, rapid as it runs, the single spokes are lost.</p><p>The gazing multitudes admire around:</p><p>Two active tumblers in the centre bound;</p><p>Now high, now low, their pliant limbs they bend:</p><p>And general songs the sprightly revel end.</p><p>Thus the broad shield complete the artist crown'd</p><p>With his last hand, and pour'd the ocean round:</p><p>In living silver seem'd the waves to roll,</p><p>And beat the buckler's verge, and bound the whole.</p></div> </div>
