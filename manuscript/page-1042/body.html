<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The gleaming champaign glows with brazen light.</p><p>Amid both hosts (a dreadful space) appear,</p><p>There great Achilles; bold Ã†neas, here.</p><p>With towering strides Aeneas first advanced;</p><p>The nodding plumage on his helmet danced:</p><p>Spread o'er his breast the fencing shield he bore,</p><p>And, so he moved, his javelin flamed before.</p><p>Not so Pelides; furious to engage,</p><p>He rush'd impetuous. Such the lion's rage,</p><p>Who viewing first his foes with scornful eyes,</p><p>Though all in arms the peopled city rise,</p><p>Stalks careless on, with unregarding pride;</p><p>Till at the length, by some brave youth defied,</p><p>To his bold spear the savage turns alone,</p><p>He murmurs fury with a hollow groan;</p><p>He grins, he foams, he rolls his eyes around</p><p>Lash'd by his tail his heaving sides resound;</p><p>He calls up all his rage; he grinds his teeth,</p></div> </div>
