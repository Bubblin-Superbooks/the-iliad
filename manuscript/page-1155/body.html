<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In vain to grasp the visionary shade!</p><p>Like a thin smoke he sees the spirit fly,</p><p>And hears a feeble, lamentable cry.</p><p>Confused he wakes; amazement breaks the bands</p><p>Of golden sleep, and starting from the sands,</p><p>Pensive he muses with uplifted hands:</p><p>"'Tis true, 'tis certain; man, though dead, retains</p><p>Part of himself; the immortal mind remains:</p><p>The form subsists without the body's aid,</p><p>Aerial semblance, and an empty shade!</p><p>This night my friend, so late in battle lost,</p><p>Stood at my side, a pensive, plaintive ghost:</p><p>Even now familiar, as in life, he came;</p><p>Alas! how different! yet how like the same!"</p><p>Thus while he spoke, each eye grew big with tears:</p><p>And now the rosy-finger'd morn appears,</p><p>Shows every mournful face with tears o'erspread,</p><p>And glares on the pale visage of the dead.</p></div> </div>
