<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Pallas opposed her hand, and caused to glance</p><p>Far from the car the strong immortal lance.</p><p>Then threw the force of Tydeus' warlike son;</p><p>The javelin hiss'd; the goddess urged it on:</p><p>Where the broad cincture girt his armour round,</p><p>It pierced the god: his groin received the wound.</p><p>From the rent skin the warrior tugs again</p><p>The smoking steel. Mars bellows with the pain:</p><p>Loud as the roar encountering armies yield,</p><p>When shouting millions shake the thundering field.</p><p>Both armies start, and trembling gaze around;</p><p>And earth and heaven re-bellow to the sound.</p><p>As vapours blown by Auster's sultry breath,</p><p>Pregnant with plagues, and shedding seeds of death,</p><p>Beneath the rage of burning Sirius rise,</p><p>Choke the parch'd earth, and blacken all the skies;</p><p>In such a cloud the god from combat driven,</p><p>High o'er the dusky whirlwind scales the heaven.</p></div> </div>
