<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>On lofty beams of solid timber hung:</p><p>Then thundering through the planks with forceful sway,</p><p>Drives the sharp rock; the solid beams give way,</p><p>The folds are shatter'd; from the crackling door</p><p>Leap the resounding bars, the flying hinges roar.</p><p>Now rushing in, the furious chief appears,</p><p>Gloomy as night! and shakes two shining spears:</p><p>A dreadful gleam from his bright armour came,</p><p>And from his eye-balls flash'd the living flame.</p><p>He moves a god, resistless in his course,</p><p>And seems a match for more than mortal force.</p><p>Then pouring after, through the gaping space,</p><p>A tide of Trojans flows, and fills the place;</p><p>The Greeks behold, they tremble, and they fly;</p><p>The shore is heap'd with death, and tumult rends the sky.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
