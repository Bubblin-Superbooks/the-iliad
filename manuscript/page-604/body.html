<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As the red star now shows his sanguine fires</p><p>Through the dark clouds, and now in night retires,</p><p>Thus through the ranks appear'd the godlike man,</p><p>Plunged in the rear, or blazing in the van;</p><p>While streamy sparkles, restless as he flies,</p><p>Flash from his arms, as lightning from the skies.</p><p>As sweating reapers in some wealthy field,</p><p>Ranged in two bands, their crooked weapons wield,</p><p>Bear down the furrows, till their labours meet;</p><p>Thick fall the heapy harvests at their feet:</p><p>So Greece and Troy the field of war divide,</p><p>And falling ranks are strow'd on every side.</p><p>None stoop'd a thought to base inglorious flight;</p><p>But horse to horse, and man to man they fight,</p><p>Not rabid wolves more fierce contest their prey;</p><p>Each wounds, each bleeds, but none resign the day.</p><p>Discord with joy the scene of death descries,</p><p>And drinks large slaughter at her sanguine eyes:</p></div> </div>
