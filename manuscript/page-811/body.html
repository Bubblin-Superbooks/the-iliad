<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Greeks expect the shock, the clamours rise</p><p>From different parts, and mingle in the skies.</p><p>Dire was the hiss of darts, by heroes flung,</p><p>And arrows leaping from the bow-string sung;</p><p>These drink the life of generous warriors slain:</p><p>Those guiltless fall, and thirst for blood in vain.</p><p>As long as Phoebus bore unmoved the shield,</p><p>Sat doubtful conquest hovering o'er the field;</p><p>But when aloft he shakes it in the skies,</p><p>Shouts in their ears, and lightens in their eyes,</p><p>Deep horror seizes every Grecian breast,</p><p>Their force is humbled, and their fear confess'd.</p><p>So flies a herd of oxen, scatter'd wide,</p><p>No swain to guard them, and no day to guide,</p><p>When two fell lions from the mountain come,</p><p>And spread the carnage through the shady gloom.</p><p>Impending Phoebus pours around them fear,</p><p>And Troy and Hector thunder in the rear.</p></div> </div>
