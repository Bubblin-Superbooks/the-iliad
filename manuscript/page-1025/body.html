<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>O'erlooks the embattled host, and hopes the bloody day.</p><p>The silver cuishes first his thighs infold;</p><p>Then o'er his breast was braced the hollow gold;</p><p>The brazen sword a various baldric tied,</p><p>That, starr'd with gems, hung glittering at his side;</p><p>And, like the moon, the broad refulgent shield</p><p>Blazed with long rays, and gleam'd athwart the field.</p><p>So to night-wandering sailors, pale with fears,</p><p>Wide o'er the watery waste, a light appears,</p><p>Which on the far-seen mountain blazing high,</p><p>Streams from some lonely watch-tower to the sky:</p><p>With mournful eyes they gaze, and gaze again;</p><p>Loud howls the storm, and drives them o'er the main.</p><p>Next, his high head the helmet graced; behind</p><p>The sweepy crest hung floating in the wind:</p><p>Like the red star, that from his flaming hair</p><p>Shakes down diseases, pestilence, and war;</p></div> </div>
