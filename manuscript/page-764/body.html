<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The old, yet still successful, cheat of love;</p><p>Against his wisdom to oppose her charms,</p><p>And lull the lord of thunders in her arms.</p><p>Swift to her bright apartment she repairs,</p><p>Sacred to dress and beauty's pleasing cares:</p><p>With skill divine had Vulcan form'd the bower,</p><p>Safe from access of each intruding power.</p><p>Touch'd with her secret key, the doors unfold:</p><p>Self-closed, behind her shut the valves of gold.</p><p>Here first she bathes; and round her body pours</p><p>Soft oils of fragrance, and ambrosial showers:</p><p>The winds, perfumed, the balmy gale convey</p><p>Through heaven, through earth, and all the aerial way:</p><p>Spirit divine! whose exhalation greets</p><p>The sense of gods with more than mortal sweets.</p><p>Thus while she breathed of heaven, with decent pride</p><p>Her artful hands the radiant tresses tied;</p><p>Part on her head in shining ringlets roll'd,</p></div> </div>
