<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">articles.</p><p>The three-and-twentieth day still continues throughout this book. The scene is sometimes in the fields before Troy, and sometimes in Troy itself.</p><p>Thus by their leaders' care each martial band</p><p>Moves into ranks, and stretches o'er the land.</p><p>With shouts the Trojans, rushing from afar,</p><p>Proclaim their motions, and provoke the war</p><p>So when inclement winters vex the plain</p><p>With piercing frosts, or thick-descending rain,</p><p>To warmer seas the cranes embodied fly,</p><p>With noise, and order, through the midway sky;</p><p>To pigmy nations wounds and death they bring,</p><p>And all the war descends upon the wing,</p><p>But silent, breathing rage, resolved and skill'd</p><p>By mutual aids to fix a doubtful field,</p><p>Swift march the Greeks: the rapid dust around</p><p>Darkening arises from the labour'd ground.</p></div> </div>
