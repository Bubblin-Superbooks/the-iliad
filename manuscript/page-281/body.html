The Breach Of The Truce, And The First Battle.</h3><p class="  start-chapter">The gods deliberate in council concerning the Trojan war: they agree upon the continuation of it, and Jupiter sends down Minerva to break the truce. She persuades Pandarus to aim an arrow at Menelaus, who is wounded, but cured by Machaon. In the meantime some of the Trojan troops attack the Greeks.

Nestor is particularly celebrated for his military discipline. The battle joins, and great numbers are slain on both sides.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The same day continues through this as through the last</p></div> </div>
