<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A spreading elm, that overhung the flood;</p><p>He seized a bending bough, his steps to stay;</p><p>The plant uprooted to his weight gave way.</p><p>Heaving the bank, and undermining all;</p><p>Loud flash the waters to the rushing fall</p><p>Of the thick foliage.
