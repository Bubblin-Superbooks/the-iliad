<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>While the sad father answers groans with groans</p><p>Tears after tears his mournful cheeks o'erflow,</p><p>And the whole city wears one face of woe:</p><p>No less than if the rage of hostile fires.</p><p>From her foundations curling to her spires,</p><p>O'er the proud citadel at length should rise,</p><p>And the last blaze send Ilion to the skies.</p><p>The wretched monarch of the falling state,</p><p>Distracted, presses to the Dardan gate.</p><p>Scarce the whole people stop his desperate course,</p><p>While strong affliction gives the feeble force:</p><p>Grief tears his heart, and drives him to and fro,</p><p>In all the raging impotence of woe.</p><p>At length he roll'd in dust, and thus begun,</p><p>Imploring all, and naming one by one:</p><p>"Ah! let me, let me go where sorrow calls;</p><p>I, only I, will issue from your walls</p><p>(Guide or companion, friends!
