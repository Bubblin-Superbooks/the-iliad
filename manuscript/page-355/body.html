<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>From his proud car the prince impetuous springs,</p><p>On earth he leaps, his brazen armour rings.</p><p>Two shining spears are brandish'd in his hands;</p><p>Thus arm'd, he animates his drooping bands,</p><p>Revives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,</p><p>And wakes anew the dying flames of fight.</p><p>They turn, they stand; the Greeks their fury dare,</p><p>Condense their powers, and wait the growing war.</p><p>As when, on Ceres' sacred floor, the swain</p><p>Spreads the wide fan to clear the golden grain,</p><p>And the light chaff, before the breezes borne,</p><p>Ascends in clouds from off the heapy corn;</p><p>The grey dust, rising with collected winds,</p><p>Drives o'er the barn, and whitens all the hinds:</p><p>So white with dust the Grecian host appears.</p><p>From trampling steeds, and thundering charioteers;</p><p>The dusky clouds from labour'd earth arise,</p><p>And roll in smoking volumes to the skies.</p></div> </div>
