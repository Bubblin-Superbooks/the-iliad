<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The sire of gods, confirming Thetis' prayer,</p><p>The Grecian ardour quench'd in deep despair;</p><p>But lifts to glory Troy's prevailing bands,</p><p>Swells all their hearts, and strengthens all their hands.</p><p>On Ida's top he waits with longing eyes,</p><p>To view the navy blazing to the skies;</p><p>Then, nor till then, the scale of war shall turn,</p><p>The Trojans fly, and conquer'd Ilion burn.</p><p>These fates revolved in his almighty mind,</p><p>He raises Hector to the work design'd,</p><p>Bids him with more than mortal fury glow,</p><p>And drives him, like a lightning, on the foe.</p><p>So Mars, when human crimes for vengeance call,</p><p>Shakes his huge javelin, and whole armies fall.</p><p>Not with more rage a conflagration rolls,</p><p>Wraps the vast mountains, and involves the poles.</p><p>He foams with wrath; beneath his gloomy brow</p><p>Like fiery meteors his red eye-balls glow:</p></div> </div>
