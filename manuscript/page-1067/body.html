<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Driven from the land before the smoky cloud,</p><p>The clustering legions rush into the flood:</p><p>So, plunged in Xanthus by Achilles' force,</p><p>Roars the resounding surge with men and horse.</p><p>His bloody lance the hero casts aside,</p><p>(Which spreading tamarisks on the margin hide,)</p><p>Then, like a god, the rapid billows braves,</p><p>Arm'd with his sword, high brandish'd o'er the waves:</p><p>Now down he plunges, now he whirls it round,</p><p>Deep groan'd the waters with the dying sound;</p><p>Repeated wounds the reddening river dyed,</p><p>And the warm purple circled on the tide.</p><p>Swift through the foamy flood the Trojans fly,</p><p>And close in rocks or winding caverns lie:</p><p>So the huge dolphin tempesting the main,</p><p>In shoals before him fly the scaly train,</p><p>Confusedly heap'd they seek their inmost caves,</p><p>Or pant and heave beneath the floating waves.</p></div> </div>
