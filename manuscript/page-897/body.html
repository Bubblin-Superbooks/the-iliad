<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Stung with fierce hunger, each the prey invades,</p><p>And echoing roars rebellow through the shades.</p><p>Stern Hector fastens on the warrior's head,</p><p>And by the foot Patroclus drags the dead:</p><p>While all around, confusion, rage, and fright,</p><p>Mix the contending hosts in mortal fight.</p><p>So pent by hills, the wild winds roar aloud</p><p>In the deep bosom of some gloomy wood;</p><p>Leaves, arms, and trees, aloft in air are blown,</p><p>The broad oaks crackle, and the Sylvans groan;</p><p>This way and that, the rattling thicket bends,</p><p>And the whole forest in one crash descends.</p><p>Not with less noise, with less tumultuous rage,</p><p>In dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage.</p><p>Darts shower'd on darts, now round the carcase ring;</p><p>Now flights of arrows bounding from the string:</p><p>Stones follow stones; some clatter on the fields,</p><p>Some hard, and heavy, shake the sounding shields.</p></div> </div>
