<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Two stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds;</p><p>They tug, they sweat; but neither gain, nor yield,</p><p>One foot, one inch, of the contended field;</p><p>Thus obstinate to death, they fight, they fall;</p><p>Nor these can keep, nor those can win the wall.</p><p>Their manly breasts are pierced with many a wound,</p><p>Loud strokes are heard, and rattling arms resound;</p><p>The copious slaughter covers all the shore,</p><p>And the high ramparts drip with human gore.</p><p>As when two scales are charged with doubtful loads,</p><p>From side to side the trembling balance nods,</p><p>(While some laborious matron, just and poor,</p><p>With nice exactness weighs her woolly store,)</p><p>Till poised aloft, the resting beam suspends</p><p>Each equal weight; nor this, nor that, descends:</p><p>So stood the war, till Hector's matchless might,</p><p>With fates prevailing, turn'd the scale of fight.</p><p>Fierce as a whirlwind up the walls he flies,</p></div> </div>
