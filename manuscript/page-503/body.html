<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>O'er the dark trees a yellower verdure shed,</p><p>And tip with silver every mountain's head:</p><p>Then shine the vales, the rocks in prospect rise,</p><p>A flood of glory bursts from all the skies:</p><p>The conscious swains, rejoicing in the sight,</p><p>Eye the blue vault, and bless the useful light.</p><p>So many flames before proud Ilion blaze,</p><p>And lighten glimmering Xanthus with their rays.</p><p>The long reflections of the distant fires</p><p>Gleam on the walls, and tremble on the spires.</p><p>A thousand piles the dusky horrors gild,</p><p>And shoot a shady lustre o'er the field.</p><p>Full fifty guards each flaming pile attend,</p><p>Whose umber'd arms, by fits, thick flashes send,</p><p>Loud neigh the coursers o'er their heaps of corn,</p><p>And ardent warriors wait the rising morn.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
